# Browser Fingerprint

A simple example showing how to create a HTML5 Canvas Fingerprint. Browser 
fingerprinting can be used to create additional entropy, or it can be used for 
online tracking purposes.

Browser fingerprinting is a technique that relies on the fact that the same canvas 
image, may be rendered differently in different computers.
